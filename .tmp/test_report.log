QA Engineer Report: SEO Optimization
- Investigated seobility.net report regarding Title Domain ("67Lab.ai" present) and word repetitions.
- Investigated Canonical logic pointing to "https://67lab.ai".
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` metadata variables.
- Removed exact domain phrases from root Title ("67Lab.ai | Finance-Grade AI Automation").
- Changed title to `Custom AI MVP Development & Automation Agency` which matches H1 text "AI MVPs" and keyword "Automation".
- Re-aligned canonical URL structure to `https://www.67lab.ai` in the next.js settings to match the indexer's target crawl URL.
- Ignored phantom duplicates: the "Marquee" element text duplication error is an intentional frontend CSS trick (it has `aria-hidden="true"`) to achieve the scroll effect.
Status: PASS (Changes deployed)
